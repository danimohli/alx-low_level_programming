# Search Algorithms

## Description
This project implements various search algorithms in C. The goal is to understand the different complexities and efficiencies of these algorithms by implementing them and analyzing their performance. The algorithms implemented include linear search, binary search, and potentially more advanced search methods.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several source files, each containing the implementation of a specific search algorithm. Each algorithm is tested with a main file, and the function prototypes are declared in a common header file.

## Compilation
To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o search_algos
